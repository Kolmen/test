This README file describes how to use the **iis2iclx_tilt_angle_DT_generator.c** program to generate decision trees for tilt sensing, how to create an .ucf configuration file for the **Machine Learning Core (MLC)** of the [**IIS2ICLX**](https://www.st.com/en/mems-and-sensors/iis2iclx.html) and finally how to evaluate the result.


- An **`.ucf`** file (Unico Configuration File), containing the device configuration generated by [**Unico GUI**]( https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/unico-gui.html ). This file can be loaded in different software tools ([Unico GUI](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/evaluation-tool-software/unico-gui.html) , [Unicleo GUI](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/evaluation-tool-software/unicleo-gui.html) , [AlgoBuilder GUI](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mems-and-sensors-software/inemo-engine-software-libraries/algobuilder.html), etc...) in combination with different hardware tools ([STEVAL-MKI109V3]( https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/mems-motion-sensor-eval-boards/steval-mki109v3.html ), [STM32 Nucleo](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/mcu-mpu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-mpu-eval-tools/stm32-nucleo-boards.html), [SensorTile.box](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/mems-motion-sensor-eval-boards/steval-mksbox1v1.html), etc...) provided by ST. The following section describes how to use the file using the different tools.



**Software** Tools:

The picture below shows the workflow to implement the five steps above and the different software tools that can be used.

For the example discussed here, **AlgoBuilder GUI**, **Unicleo GUI** and **Unico GUI** software tools will be used.

For more details on the software tools:

- [Unico GUI](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/unico-gui.html) software tool useful to generate the LSM6DSOX MLC configuration

**Hardware**: 

In this example we will be using the **LSM6DSOX inertial measurement unit (IMU)** with an accelerometer and a gyroscope sensor. This sensor is one of several sensors that are included with SensorTile.box. The same procedure shown in this tutorial also applies to other ST sensors with MLC support.
